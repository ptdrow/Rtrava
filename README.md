Library for the Strava API v3 in R


THIS PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED. The Rtrava project is no longer developed and it was merged to the [rStrava package](https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava).

----------
This library allows retrieving data from the running and cycling tracker Strava, directly from its API. It is coded in R language and uses the httr package to deal with the API. Here you can see a demo Shiny app that uses Strava data previously downloaded with the Rtrava functions: [https://ptdrow.shinyapps.io/SegmentApp/](https://ptdrow.shinyapps.io/SegmentApp/)

To use the library you need your own app client and secret from the Developers page of Strava. See the API documentation for more info on how to register your own app and the resources availables from the API: http://strava.github.io/api/
